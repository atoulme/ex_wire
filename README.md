# ExWire

Elixir Client for RLPx, DevP2P and Eth Wire Protocol.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_wire` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:ex_wire, "~> 0.1.2"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_wire](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_wire).

## Usage

For the time being, this can be used to sync the block chain from a given network (currently defaulted to Ropsten).

You can run `iex -S mix` and you should see:

```
12:59:23.818 [debug] [Network] [6ce059...1acd9d] Established outbound connection with 13.84.180.240, sending auth.

12:59:24.595 [debug] [Block Queue] Verified block and added to new block tree
```

In the future, we will continue to grow and built out a proper syncing ability. It's likely the proper interface (with CLI tools) will not be this module directly, but instead a general CLI which calls into this module.
